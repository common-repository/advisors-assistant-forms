Transfer form data directly into Advisors Assistant CRM. Developer can use multiple conditions for controlling data transfers.

== Description ==
Advisors Assistant CRM is designed for the Financial Services sector.  Our users include Investment Advisors, Banks, and Insurance agents and agencies.

The Advisors Assistant Plugin lets you send data from your Gravity Forms directly to the your Advisors Assistant database.  But besides just sending data, it has these professional features:

* Capture free form notes data so clients and prospects can use their own words to enhance the information on the form.
* Create note topics in Advisors Assistant.
* Initiate a workflow in Advisors Assistant to create calendar tasks based on the type of form being filled in.
* Duplicate detection so new contacts are not created when the data matches existing contacts in Advisors Assistant.
* Developers can establish one of more conditions using AND or OR conditions to control the insertion of data into Advisors Assistant.
